# Simplify Structure and Styling

## Avoiding Div Soup

As a developer, it can be quite overwhelming to look at code that is swimming in div soup. An intent gaze scans the page for anything that stands out, but sadly is unable to focus on any one item. The experience can be time consuming and unpleaseant. 

But, refactoring code can be a great opportunity to familiarize oneself with the usage and benefits of HTML semantic structure . With this advantage in mind, I gladly dove into this project of refactoring the html code and corresponding styling sheet. The divs were indeed deep, but the structure was there just below the surface.

The challenge of refactoring existing code is finding areas to implement improvements, while making sure that the functionality remains intact and unchanged. This particular code has navigation links and a stylized company name that highlight the unique company brand of the client. The extensive div elements bloat the code and slow it down. It can result in a loss of performance, which in this particular code led to an inoperative link. Refactoring the code made it easier to identify CSS bugs and repair the issue.

My goal for the project is to improve the codebase overall, making it easier to maintain into the future and improving user experience. In addition to updating the generic div elements with specific HTML elements, I streamlined the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties and reducing the number of Class attributes.

To increase accesibility, alt attributes were added to images.
